# üéØ DAREBET SMART CONTRACT - COMPLETE BREAKDOWN

## üìä CRITICAL ISSUE TO FIX BEFORE DEPLOYMENT

**‚ùå INVALID PROGRAM ID:**
```rust
declare_id!("11111111111111111111111111111111");
```

This is the default/placeholder ID. **MUST BE REPLACED** after building and deploying the program.

---

## üèóÔ∏è SMART CONTRACT ARCHITECTURE

### **Core Concept:**
A decentralized betting platform where users bet on whether someone can complete a dare. Dare creators submit proof, admin selects top 3 winners, and funds are distributed accordingly.

---

## üí∞ MONEY FLOW & DISTRIBUTION

### **When Bets Are Placed:**
- Users bet SOL on either "Will Do" or "Won't Do"
- All funds go into a **Pool Account** (PDA)
- Pools are tracked separately: `will_do_pool` & `wont_do_pool`

### **Payout Distribution (If Dare Completed with Winners):**

**Total Pool Breakdown:**
- **2%** ‚Üí Dare Creator Fee
- **98%** ‚Üí Available for distribution

**From the 98% Available Pool:**
- **30%** ‚Üí 1st Place Winner (proof submitter)
- **15%** ‚Üí 2nd Place Winner (proof submitter)
- **5%** ‚Üí 3rd Place Winner (proof submitter)
- **50% (remaining 48% of total)** ‚Üí Split among "Will Do" bettors proportionally

### **If Dare Expires (No Completion):**
- **2%** ‚Üí Creator Fee
- **98%** ‚Üí Split among "Won't Do" bettors proportionally

---

## üîÑ COMPLETE USER FLOW

### **1. CREATE DARE**
```rust
create_dare(title, description, deadline, min_bet)
```
- Creator sets up the dare challenge
- Specifies minimum bet amount
- Sets deadline timestamp
- Pool account (PDA) is created to hold all bets

**Accounts Created:**
- `Dare` account (stores all dare data)
- `Pool` PDA account (holds all SOL)

---

### **2. PLACE BETS**
```rust
place_bet(amount, bet_type) // bet_type = WillDo or WontDo
```
- Users bet SOL on outcome
- Amount must be ‚â• `min_bet`
- Can only bet before deadline
- SOL transferred from bettor ‚Üí Pool PDA

**Validation:**
- ‚úÖ Bet amount >= minimum
- ‚úÖ Before deadline
- ‚úÖ Dare not completed

---

### **3. SUBMIT PROOF** (Multiple submissions allowed)
```rust
submit_proof(proof_hash, proof_description)
```
- Anyone can submit proof of dare completion
- `proof_hash` = IPFS hash from Pinata (video/image proof)
- Multiple users can submit (tracked via `submission_count`)
- All submissions start as **NOT APPROVED**

**Proof Submission Account:**
- Links to dare
- Stores IPFS hash
- Tracks likes, approval status, winner status

---

### **4. SELECT WINNERS** (Admin Only)
```rust
select_winners(first_place_pubkey, second_place_pubkey, third_place_pubkey)
```
- **Only platform_authority** can call this
- Can only be called **after deadline**
- Selects top 3 proof submissions as winners
- Marks dare as `is_completed = true`
- Sets `winners_selected = true`

**Restrictions:**
- ‚è∞ Must be after deadline
- üîê Only admin can call
- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Can only select once

---

### **5. CLAIM REWARDS** (Multiple claim functions)

#### **A. Winner Claims Reward**
```rust
claim_winner_reward()
```
- 1st place gets 30% of available pool
- 2nd place gets 15% of available pool
- 3rd place gets 5% of available pool
- Each winner claims individually
- Transfers SOL from Pool PDA ‚Üí Winner

#### **B. Bettor Claims Winnings**
```rust
claim_winnings()
```
- **If dare completed with winners:** "Will Do" bettors share remaining 48%
- **If dare expired:** "Won't Do" bettors share 98% (minus 2% creator fee)
- Payout proportional to bet amount
- Transfers SOL from Pool PDA ‚Üí Bettor

#### **C. Creator Claims Fee**
```rust
claim_creator_fee()
```
- Creator gets 2% of total pool
- Can claim after deadline or completion
- One-time claim only

---

### **6. CASH OUT EARLY** (Optional)
```rust
cash_out_early()
```
- Bettors can exit their bet early
- **10% penalty** applied
- Must cash out **within 10 minutes of placing the bet**
- Removes bet from pools
- Returns 90% of bet amount

**Restrictions:**
- ‚è∞ Must be within 10 minutes of bet placement
- ‚ùå Can't cash out after dare completed
- ‚ùå Can't cash out after 10-minute window expires

---

## üé≤ POSSIBLE SCENARIOS

### **Scenario 1: Successful Dare with Winners**
1. Creator creates dare
2. Users place bets (50 SOL "Will Do", 30 SOL "Won't Do")
3. 5 people submit proof videos
4. Admin selects top 3 winners
5. **Payouts:**
   - Creator: 1.6 SOL (2%)
   - 1st place: 23.52 SOL (30% of 78.4)
   - 2nd place: 11.76 SOL (15% of 78.4)
   - 3rd place: 3.92 SOL (5% of 78.4)
   - "Will Do" bettors: 39.2 SOL split proportionally

### **Scenario 2: Dare Expires (No Completion)**
1. Creator creates dare
2. Users place bets (50 SOL "Will Do", 30 SOL "Won't Do")
3. Deadline passes, no proof submitted or no winners selected
4. **Payouts:**
   - Creator: 1.6 SOL (2%)
   - "Won't Do" bettors: 78.4 SOL split proportionally
   - "Will Do" bettors: Get nothing

### **Scenario 3: Early Cash Out**
1. User bets 10 SOL "Will Do"
2. **5 minutes later**, wants out
3. Calls `cash_out_early()`
4. Gets back 9 SOL (10% penalty)
5. 1 SOL stays in pool
6. **After 10 minutes**: Cash out button is DISABLED

---

## üîê SECURITY FEATURES

### **PDA (Program Derived Addresses):**
- Pool account is a PDA controlled by program
- Only program can transfer funds out
- Seeds: `[b"pool", dare_pubkey]`

### **Access Controls:**
- Only admin can select winners
- Only bet owner can claim/cash out
- Only dare creator can claim creator fee

### **Double-Claim Protection:**
- `is_claimed` flag on bets
- `reward_claimed` flag on proof submissions
- `creator_fee_claimed` flag on dares

### **Time-Based Logic:**
- Deadline enforcement
- 10-minute cash-out buffer
- Expiration handling

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED BEFORE DEPLOYMENT

### **1. FIX PROGRAM ID**
```rust
// REPLACE THIS:
declare_id!("11111111111111111111111111111111");

// WITH YOUR ACTUAL DEPLOYED PROGRAM ID AFTER:
// anchor build
// anchor deploy
```

### **2. SET PROPER PLATFORM AUTHORITY**
Currently, the dare creator is set as platform authority:
```rust
dare.platform_authority = ctx.accounts.creator.key();
```

**For production**, you should:
- Create a dedicated admin keypair
- Store it securely
- Use it as platform authority

### **3. VERIFY PROOF HASH LENGTHS**
Current limits:
- `proof_hash`: max 64 chars
- IPFS hashes are ~46 chars (CIDv0) or ~59 chars (CIDv1)
- ‚úÖ Should be fine, but verify your Pinata hashes fit
